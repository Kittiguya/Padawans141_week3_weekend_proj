Theres notes inside next to lines. Although they may be jumbled up by now.
I've made tons of changes since my first upload. 
I originally had a weirdly made program that functioned, but only 2 of the 4-6 functions in it at the time were using OOP.
So i went back after a break and converted those functions to OOP functions making use of .self()
After i did that, i looked for ways to clean up the document. So i deleted a bunch of text.
Then while deleting text, and running the values, i noticed a user couldnt use $ or ,
so i added a .replace() in multiple spots to allow users to input those. 
After that, i realized i didnt give the user a way to input Down payment, closing costs, and rehab costs
So i added another list and a function that allowed a user to input them. 
Ultimately, this covers the basics for a return on investment housing calculator. more stuff could be added and more things can be done to enhance user experience.
