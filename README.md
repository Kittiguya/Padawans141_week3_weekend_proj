Theres a few notes inside the coding itself. Otherwise i tried my best! It feels like i couldnt get it working properly. But when i input the values the video gave me, it seems to work. So idk whats up
It took me a lil bit longer than im willing to admit to come up with specific names for certain variables. 
OOP is cool. But heres my random readme i like adding for no reason! After another week or two of class ill be starting to create some of my own cool lil projects!! :)
